This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
data<-read_excel("Drive/TM2S_20212022.xlsx")
SCORE=data$Totaltest
POLES=data$Sport
MOBTOT=data$Totalmob
STABTOT=data$Totalstab
boxplot(SCORE~POLES, cex.axis = 0.5, main = "Score against centres Boxplots", xlab = "Centres", ylab = "Score", ylim = c(0,20))
boxplot(MOBTOT~POLES, cex.axis = 0.5, main = "Score mobility against centres Boxplots", xlab = "Centres", ylab = "Score", ylim = c(0,12))
boxplot(STABTOT~POLES, cex.axis = 0.5, main = "Score stability against centres Boxplots", xlab = "Centres", ylab = "Score", ylim = c(0,8))

#chaque sport score total mob stab
#regarder néo et anciens
```
Those boxplots represent the total score, the mobility score and the stability score of all the different sports. 
Total score : the rugby and the men basketball have lower score than the other sports. They have around 6 or 7 in 20. Climbing, synchronized (=artistic) swimming and swimming have the best scores around 15 in 20. 
For all sports, the mobility score is lower than the stability score.
```{r}
data$Neo[is.na(data$Neo)] <- "Maintien"
data$Sport=as.factor(data$Sport)
NEO=data[data$Neo=="Néo",]
MAINTIEN=data[data$Neo=="Maintien",]
BOXE=data[data$Sport=="Boxe Fr",]
ESCALADE=data[data$Sport=="Escalade",]
NATART=data[data$Sport=="Nat Art",]
NATCOURSE=data[data$Sport=="Nat Course",]
RUGBY13=data[data$Sport=="Rugby XIII",]

pie(table(MAINTIEN$Mobinfasy))

boxplot(SCORE~data$Neo)
boxplot(MOBTOT~data$Neo)
boxplot(STABTOT~data$Neo) 
```
As a general rule, the athletes who are at CREPS for one year have a better score than the athletes who are just arrived at the structure. We can see those results on the three boxplots which describe the total score of the TM2S, the mobility score and the stability score. 

```{r}

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
#AVIRON
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
boxplot(AVIRON$Totaltest,AVIRON$Totalmob,AVIRON$Totalstab,cex.axis = 0.5, main = "Different score against centres Boxplots", names=c("Total score","Mobility score","Stability score"), xlab = "Aviron", ylab = "Score", ylim = c(0,20))

pie(table(AVIRON$Mobinfasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of an inferior mobility asymmetry")
pie(table(AVIRON$Mobsupasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of a superior mobility asymmetry")
pie(table(AVIRON$Stabpelvasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of a pelvic stability asymmetry")
```
There is not a big difference between stability and mobility score. 


```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
#BASEBALL
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
boxplot(BASEBALL$Totaltest,BASEBALL$Totalmob,BASEBALL$Totalstab,cex.axis = 0.5, main = "Different score against centres Boxplots", names=c("Total score","Mobility score","Stability score"), xlab = "Baseball", ylab = "Score", ylim = c(0,20))

pie(table(BASEBALL$Mobinfasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of an inferior mobility asymmetry")
pie(table(BASEBALL$Mobsupasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of a superior mobility asymmetry")
pie(table(BASEBALL$Stabpelvasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of a pelvic stability asymmetry")
```
Baseball athletes have some asymmetries particularly a pelvic stability asymmetry. 

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
#BASKET
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
boxplot(BASKET$Totaltest,BASKET$Totalmob,BASKET$Totalstab,cex.axis = 0.5, main = "Different score against centres Boxplots", names=c("Total score","Mobility score","Stability score"), xlab = "Basket", ylab = "Score", ylim = c(0,20))

pie(table(BASKET$Mobinfasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of an inferior mobility asymmetry")
pie(table(BASKET$Mobsupasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of a superior mobility asymmetry")
pie(table(BASKET$Stabpelvasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of a pelvic stability asymmetry")
```
Basketball athletes (men and women) have generally a bad score, so a bad stability and mobility score. We notice a large number of athletes that have an asymmetry. We can understand those numbers because basketball players always use their best "side" (je sais pas commnt on dit). They are either right-handed or left-handed.

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
#BOWLING
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
boxplot(BOWLING$Totaltest,BOWLING$Totalmob,BOWLING$Totalstab,cex.axis = 0.5, main = "Different score against centres Boxplots", names=c("Total score","Mobility score","Stability score"), xlab = "Bowling", ylab = "Score", ylim = c(0,20))

pie(table(BOWLING$Mobinfasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of an inferior mobility asymmetry")
pie(table(BOWLING$Mobsupasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of a superior mobility asymmetry")
pie(table(BOWLING$Stabpelvasy),edges=100, radius=1,col=c("lightgreen", "lightyellow"),main="Existence of a pelvic stability asymmetry")
```
There is not a big difference between stability and mobility score. On average, bowling players do not have a score higher than 10 in 20. There is some asymmetries.  

```{r}
data_asy<-read_excel("asy_poles.xlsx")
data_asy = as.data.frame(matrix(c(2,3,12,5,5,5,3,1,0,1,8,0,1,4,3,1,3,9,9,4,11,6,5,8),ncol=3))
rownames(data_asy)=c("Aviron","Baseball","Basket","Bowling","Boxe","NatArt","NatCourse","RugbyXIII")
colnames(data_asy)=c("Mobinfasy","Mobsupasy","Stabpelvasy")
data_asy
```
We are testing if the sport is related to an asymmetry or not.
```{r}
Ind=chisq.test(data_asy)
Ind
```
We notice that the p value is higher than 0.05 (5%). We can conclude that the sport and the asymetry are not related, they are independent.
```{r}
data_asy_mobinf = as.data.frame(matrix(c(2,3,12,5,5,5,3,1),ncol=1))
rownames(data_asy_mobinf)=c("Aviron","Baseball","Basket","Bowling","Boxe","NatArt","NatCourse","RugbyXIII")
colnames(data_asy_mobinf)=c("Mobinfasy")
#data_asy_mobinf
data_asy_mobsup = as.data.frame(matrix(c(0,1,8,0,1,4,3,1),ncol=1))
rownames(data_asy_mobsup)=c("Aviron","Baseball","Basket","Bowling","Boxe","NatArt","NatCourse","RugbyXIII")
colnames(data_asy_mobsup)=c("Mobsupasy")
#data_asy_mobsup
data_asy_stabpelv = as.data.frame(matrix(c(3,9,9,4,11,6,5,8),ncol=1))
rownames(data_asy_stabpelv)=c("Aviron","Baseball","Basket","Bowling","Boxe","NatArt","NatCourse","RugbyXIII")
colnames(data_asy_stabpelv)=c("Stabpelv")
data_asy_stabpelv
```
```{r}
Indmobinf=chisq.test(data_asy_mobinf)
Indmobinf
```
We reject the independence with a 5% risk. There is a correlation between sports and the inferior mobility asymmetry.

```{r}
Indmobsup=chisq.test(data_asy_mobsup)
Indmobsup
```
We reject the independence with a 5% risk. There is a correlation between sports and the superior mobility asymmetry.
```{r}
Indstabpelv=chisq.test(data_asy_stabpelv)
Indstabpelv
```
We accept the independence with a 5% risk. We can say that it does not exist a correlation between the sport and the stabpelv asymmetry.
